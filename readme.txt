State in which cases (if any) you used "-oversubscribe" (to allow the number of processes to exceed the number of physical cores):
The `--oversubscribe` flag was used for **p = 16** and **p = 32**.

Provide a brief interpretation of your results:
1. **Performance Scaling:** The execution time decreases as the number of processes increases, showing good parallel speed-up up to `p=8`.
2. **Diminishing Returns:** Beyond `p=8`, speed-up gains start to level off due to communication overhead.
3. **Communication Overhead:** The drop in efficiency for `p=32` indicates that inter-process communication is a limiting factor.
4. **Optimal Performance:** The best performance gain is observed around `p=8` or `p=16` before diminishing returns set in.
